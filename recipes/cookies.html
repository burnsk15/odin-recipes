        <h3>The most amzing soft chocolate chip cookies you will ever 
            have</h3>
            <p>This is the absolute most amazing recipe for soft and chewy
                chocolate chip cookies. I like to make mine with dark 
                chocolate chips.

                <li>Add eggs and vanilla and mix until just combined.</li>
                <li>Add flour, baking soda, and salt and mix until just
                    combined. be careful not to over mix.</li>
                <li>Form in larger balls, about 3 tbsps worth, and bake
                    8-10 minutes long. They will seem pale and puffy but
                    believe.</li>
